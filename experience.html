<b><h2>1.Hospital Food Service Worker (January-March 2018)</h2></b>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">In January 2018, I was accepted to work at Hospital Putrajaya as a waitress or known as "Pramusaji" in Malay which I need to served and deliver foods to the patients in specific wards.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">We are tasked to prepare food in the patient’s food tray according to the total number of patients in each ward which we called “Trayline Session”. Each employee has their own tasks such as scooping side dishes, placing rice, arranging plates and so on. Once ready to prepare the food we rushed to go up to our respective wards to deliver food to the patients using a trolley.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">Based on the picture above, it is our trolley that we usually use to organized the food trays. <br>In my opinion, to be a waitress that served the food in the hospital, it required a lot of patient and stamina as we literally do almost everything from placing the food in the trays, organized, delivered and others. However, it was a good experience for me and there are a lot of moments that I would like to remember until I grow older. </p>

<br>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Right after I have finished my Pre-Diploma at the of January, I got a job as a Nursery teacher at a Child Care Center called Taska Kasih Tokmi.I was assigned to manage the kids aged 3 years and above where they were sent by parents during the day.I was assigned to manage them in terms of play school activities,their attire, eating and drinking and so on. Working as a nursery teacher is arguably the same as babysitting but the different is we have to teach them to be good at communicating with friends and teachers and be more<br> independent before they going to enter the kindergarten.</p>

<center><img src="kidsazwa.jpg" alt="Kids" width="400" height="250" border="1" ></center>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Throughout working as a nursery teacher, I learned so many things about children’s behavior that taught me the meaning of gratitude to both my parents who took care of me from baby up till now with full of patient. Children’s behavior reflects the teachings from their parents and those around them. Therefore, I am very careful in every action I do infront of them. In conclusion, I am very happy to be able to took care of them even if there is cheekiness but they can also cheer up my heart.</p>
